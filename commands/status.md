description: Show the current conductor briefing — active epic, detour stack, next up
allowed-tools: Bash, Read

Show where the project stands.

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/conductor.mjs" render
```
(If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is empty:
`ENGINE=$(ls -t ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/pm/*/scripts/conductor.mjs 2>/dev/null | head -1); node "$ENGINE" render`)

Then read `PROJECT.md` and summarize for the user:
- the **active** epic and its live story progress,
- the **detour stack** (what's paused and why), flagging any ⚠ reconcile-on-resume,
- the **next-up** queue by priority.

Story counts are derived live from each proposal's `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md` — if
they look stale, the tasks.md checkboxes are the source of truth, not the index.

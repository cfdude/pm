## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- **`/pm:upgrade` staleness guard.** `/pm:upgrade` now checks whether the running engine
  version matches the newest installed version before proceeding. If they differ (i.e. the
  plugin was updated but Claude Code has not been reloaded), it refuses with a clear message
  — "this is pm <old> but <new> is installed; run `/reload-plugins` or restart Claude Code
  first" — instead of silently re-stamping an old version. From 0.4.1 forward every upgrade
  is self-guarding.

- **SessionStart nudge fires from newest installed version.** The upgrade nudge in the
  SessionStart briefing now keys on the newest installed version (from the plugin's
  `plugin.json`) rather than the running engine version. This means the nudge fires even
  before you reload Claude Code, and it names the full sequence: (1) reload/restart; (2)
  `/pm:upgrade` per repo.

- **Documented update sequence.** `upgrade.md` and README both document the required
  three-step sequence: update the plugin → `/reload-plugins` or restart → `/pm:upgrade`
  per project. The upgrade command note now explains why the reload step is mandatory
  (Claude Code loads the engine at session start).

### Limitation

The staleness guard ships inside 0.4.1, so the first upgrade *into* 0.4.1 still runs the
old 0.4.0 engine until you `/reload-plugins`. From 0.4.1 forward every upgrade is
self-guarding.

### Upgrade

**Existing repos:** run `/pm:upgrade` after updating — refreshes rules, stamps 0.4.1 into
`state.json`. Idempotent; safe to run multiple times. No data migration required. Remember
to `/reload-plugins` first (see above).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **`status: planned` — roadmap as ordered backlog.** A new epic status for items that are
  known, sequenced, but not yet ready to start. `planned: N` appears as a brief summary line
  in the briefing; planned epics are excluded from NEXT UP and the lanes rollup, but are
  shown in the PROJECT.md epics table so the full backlog is visible.

- **`sync` auto-transitions proposed planned epics → untriaged (openspec lane).** When
  `sync`/`init` discovers a new OpenSpec change on disk and an epic with the same id already
  exists with `status: planned`, it transitions that epic to `untriaged` automatically so it
  enters the normal triage flow without manual state editing.

- **PROJECT.md stamp-on-content-change only.** `render` now compares the new output to the
  current file before writing; if the content is identical, the file is not touched. Prevents
  mtime churn and spurious git diffs when nothing meaningful changed.

- **`add-epic` validates `--status` against known statuses.** Passing an unknown status to
  `/pm:epic add` is now an error rather than silently stored. A valueless-flag guard also
  catches `--status` with no argument (e.g. `--status --lane`) and reports a clear error
  instead of treating the next flag as the status value.

- **Portable `ls -t` glob in command docs.** The `find`-based file listing in `sync` command
  documentation is replaced with a portable `ls -t` glob, removing a macOS/GNU `find`
  incompatibility.

- **`--status` documented in `/pm:epic`.** The `add` sub-command now shows all valid status
  values (including `planned`) in its help text and the commands table.

- **Roadmap on-ramp guidance.** README and SKILL document how to import an existing roadmap
  into the conductor without parsing: in an interactive session, read the roadmap doc and
  register each item via `/pm:epic add … --status planned`, choosing the appropriate
  execution lane. The conductor does not parse roadmap files automatically.

### Changed

- Rules block wording updated: documents `planned` status (roadmap on-ramp), auto-transition
  of planned epics on `sync`, and stamp-on-content-change behaviour.

### Upgrade

**Existing repos:** run `/pm:upgrade` after updating — refreshes rules, stamps 0.4.0 into
`state.json`. Idempotent; safe to run multiple times. No data migration required.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Lane-agnostic epics.** Epics are no longer restricted to OpenSpec proposals. Every epic
  now carries a `lane` tag — `openspec | superpowers | claude-code | decision | external` —
  so the conductor tracks the full backlog regardless of how work is executed.

- **Epic schema fields.**
  - `lane` (string, optional, backward-compatible): execution lane. Defaults to `"openspec"`
    on read so existing `state.json` files are unaffected.
  - `planPath` (string, optional): repo-relative path to a Superpowers/markdown plan file.
    Used as a progress source when `stories[]` is absent.
  - `stories` (array, optional): inline `{ title, done }` story list. Highest-priority
    progress source.

- **Progress precedence resolver.** `epicProgress(epic)` replaces `storyProgress(id)` and
  resolves progress in order: `stories[]` → `planPath` checkboxes → `openspec/changes/<id>/tasks.md`
  → `—`. A dangling `planPath` renders `⚠ planPath missing` rather than silent `0/0`.

- **Non-OpenSpec epics in the briefing.** Non-OpenSpec epics now appear in NEXT UP and the
  Epics table. Only OpenSpec epics missing their on-disk change are flagged `⚠ no change on
  disk`; other lanes are shown as-is.

- **Bounded briefing.** NEXT UP is capped at **top-5** by priority-then-lane, with a
  per-lane count summary (`lanes: openspec 4 · superpowers 12 · claude-code 9`) and a
  `(+N more — see PROJECT.md)` overflow line, so the briefing stays compact regardless of
  backlog size.

- **`/pm:epic add`.** Registers a new epic directly (no `state.json` edit required):
  ```
  /pm:epic add --id X --title "…" --lane superpowers --priority P1
  ```
  Validates id format (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*$`), lane, and uniqueness. Optional flags:
  `--plan PATH`, `--status STATUS`, `--link "type:id:reason"`.

- **`sync` imports Superpowers plans.** `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md` are scanned on
  `sync`/`init` and registered as lane-`superpowers` epics (id = filename without `.md`,
  `planPath` set, title from first `#` heading). Additive and id-collision-safe (colliding
  ids are skipped with a warning). The plans directory may be absent — the scan returns `[]`
  gracefully.

- **Version-aware upgrade subsystem.**
  - `init` and `upgrade` stamp `pmVersion` (the running release) into `state.json`.
  - `brief()` compares the stamped version to the running release; if older, prepends a
    one-line upgrade nudge (re-shown every SessionStart and PreCompact until resolved).
  - **`/pm:upgrade`** runs registered migrations (those whose `release` is newer than the
    stamped version), then unconditionally refreshes the CLAUDE.md rules block, re-renders
    `PROJECT.md`, and re-stamps `pmVersion`. Idempotent — a second run is a no-op.
  - **0.3.0 migration:** stamps an explicit `lane: "openspec"` on any epic lacking one,
    making `state.json` self-describing.

- **Lane-agnostic detour rules.** A substantial detour becomes its own **epic in the
  appropriate lane** (not necessarily an OpenSpec proposal). The `rulesBlock()` wording and
  PUSH/POP templates are updated accordingly.

### Changed

- Epics table header changed from `Epic (OpenSpec change)` to `Epic`; a **Lane** column is
  added. Epics are sorted by priority rank then lane rank in both `PROJECT.md` and the brief.
- NOW line includes the lane tag.
- `rulesBlock()`: "epics = proposals" replaced with "epics are lane-agnostic; OpenSpec is
  one lane (openspec | superpowers | claude-code | decision | external)."

### Upgrade

**Existing repos:** after updating the plugin, run `/pm:upgrade` once. It will:

1. Refresh the CLAUDE.md rules block with lane-agnostic wording.
2. Stamp explicit `lane: "openspec"` on all pre-0.3.0 epics.
3. Record `pmVersion: "0.3.0"` in `state.json` so the upgrade nudge stops appearing.

The command is **idempotent** — running it more than once is safe and produces no changes on
the second run. No data is lost; the migration is purely additive.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-01

Initial public release. Tracks OpenSpec proposals as epics, maintains an explicit detour
stack, and enforces a reconcile gate so nothing is lost when development pivots or context
is compacted.

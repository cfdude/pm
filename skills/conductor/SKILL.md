description: >
  Project-management discipline that sits ABOVE OpenSpec and Superpowers. Use whenever
  work spans more than one epic, when a review or build reveals something
  broken/orphaned/unwired that forces a detour, when deciding what to work on next, or
  when resuming after a context compaction. Keeps a single lane-agnostic index of epics,
  an explicit detour stack, and epic links so nothing is lost across pivots.
  Triggers: "what were we working on", "what's next", "this is broken, fix it first",
  "park this", "resume", "where did we leave off".

# Conductor — the PM layer above OpenSpec + Superpowers

## Mental model (read first)

- An **epic** is any backlog item, tagged by `lane` — `openspec | superpowers | claude-code
  | decision | external`. OpenSpec proposals are one lane, not the only one.
- **Stories/phases** live in the best available source: `tasks.md` checkboxes (openspec),
  `planPath` checkboxes (superpowers), inline `stories[]` (claude-code), or `—` (decision /
  external). Never copy these into `state.json` manually unless using inline `stories[]`.
- The conductor owns ONLY what no lane-specific tool can: cross-epic **priority/ordering**,
  the **detour stack**, and **epic links** (especially the reconcile relationship).
- State of record is `.conductor/state.json`. `PROJECT.md` is a generated view — never
  hand-edit it. After any state change, run `node "$ENGINE" render` (see "Running the engine").

You (Claude) are myopic across compactions. This skill is how you stop losing the thread.

## Running the engine (resolve the path — never version-pin)

When you invoke `conductor.mjs` from a Bash step, resolve it version-independently. Prefer
`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; if that env var is unset (common outside a slash-command), fall back to the
newest installed copy. **Never** hardcode a versioned cache path like `…/pm/0.6.1/scripts/…` — it
breaks on the next upgrade.

```bash
ENGINE="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/conductor.mjs}"
[ -f "$ENGINE" ] || ENGINE=$(ls -t ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/pm/*/scripts/conductor.mjs 2>/dev/null | head -1)
node "$ENGINE" <subcommand>
```

Below, `$ENGINE` means the path resolved this way.

## Commands

`/pm:init` scaffold · `/pm:status` show · `/pm:next` decide · `/pm:detour` park ·
`/pm:resume` resume + reconcile · `/pm:sync` register new proposals and plans ·
`/pm:epic add` register any epic (`--parent`, `--external-id`) · `/pm:epic` → `add-many`
(atomic bulk create) / `update-epic` (write-back, incl. `--title`) · **`set-active <id>` /
`clear-active`** set the top-level active epic · `set-autonomy <id>` grant an epic broad
execution trust (see "Epic-level autonomy" below) · `set-review-mode` the repo's bounded
review-count dial (off/standard/thorough) · `/pm:gate-guard` optional opt-in hard reconcile-gate
backstop (off by default) · `/pm:tracker` make the conductor tracker-aware · `/pm:changelog` what
changed since your version · `/pm:upgrade` refresh rules + run migrations + print the changelog delta.

## Hierarchy & external trackers

- **Hierarchy:** epics form a single-parent tree via `parent`. Nest with `--parent <id>`
  (validated: parent exists, no self/cycle) or bulk-create a parent + children atomically with
  `add-many --from <json>`. PROJECT.md indents children and rolls up `X/Y children archived`;
  NEXT UP keeps global priority order (grouping is render-only).
- **Tracker awareness (instruction layer ONLY — never call the tracker yourself from the
  engine):** if a `tracker` block is set (via `/pm:tracker`), the rules block + brief tell YOU
  to mirror epics to Jira/GitHub/Linear with your own tooling — create an issue for any epic
  lacking `externalId` then record the key with `update-epic --external-id`, and transition the
  linked issue toward the `statusIntent` semantic target on each status change. The brief lists
  only unmirrored epics; it never fabricates transition drift.

## When something blocks progress: classify the detour FIRST

Do not start fixing. Decide which kind this is and say so.

**Minimal detour** — small, self-contained, no design ambiguity.
Fix → test → commit → push, then record it so it leaves a trail:
`node "$ENGINE" log-detour "<what you fixed>"` (appends a
timestamped line + commit SHA to `.conductor/detours.log`). Then resume. No proposal, no
stack entry. Rule of thumb: fits before the next compaction and doesn't change the shape of
the current proposal.

**Substantial detour** — needs its own design, changes shared behavior, or is multi-step.
This becomes its own **epic in the appropriate lane** (openspec, superpowers, or claude-code
as fits the scope). Run PUSH. When unsure, treat as substantial — a needless stack entry is
cheap; a lost thread is the whole problem we're solving.

## PUSH protocol (entering a substantial detour)

1. Make the current epic's progress source reflect reality; commit so nothing is uncommitted.
2. In `.conductor/state.json`: set the current epic `status: "paused"`; push a frame onto
   `detourStack`:
   ```json
   { "pausedEpic": "<current>", "pausedAt": "<iso>", "reason": "<why, concretely>",
     "spawnedDetour": "<new-epic-id>", "reconcileOnResume": true }
   ```
   Set `reconcileOnResume: true` whenever the detour will touch code/behavior the paused
   epic depends on (default true unless certain it won't).
3. Add the detour as an epic (`role: "detour"`, `lane` = appropriate lane, usually `P0`)
   with links: detour `resolves-blocker-for` parent; parent `may-invalidate` detour.
   Use `/pm:epic add` or edit `state.json` directly.
4. Make the detour active with `node "$ENGINE" set-active <detour-id>`. Build it through the
   appropriate lane's workflow,
   then archive/close it.
5. **Write a one-line Honcho memory** ("paused `<parent>` for `<detour>` — <reason>") via
   your Honcho MCP memory/conclusion tool, so the pivot survives outside this repo.

## POP protocol (leaving a detour) — the RECONCILE GATE

The step otherwise lost after compaction. Do not skip it.

1. Confirm the detour epic is archived and committed/deployed.
2. Before popping the frame: if it has `reconcileOnResume: true`, set `reconcileNeeded: true`
   on the paused epic in `.conductor/state.json` (a hand-edited field, like the frame itself) —
   the frame is about to be removed, so this is the only place that obligation survives. Then
   pop the frame and `node "$ENGINE" set-active <paused-id>` to make the paused epic active
   again.
3. If `reconcileOnResume` was true, RECONCILE before writing code: delegate to the
   **reconciler** agent with the paused id + detour id. It re-reads the paused proposal,
   diffs what the detour shipped, and reports validity + stories to amend.
   - Invalidated → amend the proposal + `tasks.md` first, then clear `reconcileNeeded`.
   - Still valid → say so explicitly, clear `reconcileNeeded`, resume.
   - **Optional hard backstop:** if this repo has `set-gate-guard on` set, a PreToolUse hook
     mechanically blocks `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit` while `reconcileNeeded` is still true —
     off by default, see `/pm:gate-guard`.
4. **Write a one-line Honcho memory** ("resumed `<parent>` after `<detour>`; reconcile =
   valid | amended …") via your Honcho MCP memory/conclusion tool.
5. Render. State the exact next story to build.

## Choosing what's next

Resume the **top of the detour stack** first if non-empty. Otherwise the highest-priority
`queued` epic (P0→P3). Surface ties to the user.

## Keeping the index honest (non-blocking enforcement)

- After completing stories: tick `tasks.md` checkboxes (OpenSpec), then render.
- After a commit: the PostToolUse hook reminds you — update `state.json` status, it
  re-renders automatically.
- Set the active epic with `set-active <id>` (never hand-edit the `.active` pointer); it also
  keeps `status: "active"` in sync and demotes any prior active epic. `clear-active` drops it.
- On PUSH/POP/priority change: edit `state.json` (or use the verbs above), then render.
- New proposal outside this flow? `/pm:sync` registers it as `untriaged`; then triage.
- Archived an OpenSpec change? The conductor self-heals — `sync`/`commit-nudge` clear the
  `active` pointer and stamp `archived` automatically (OpenSpec's date-prefixed archive dirs are
  detected), so `/pm:next` advances without hand-editing `state.json`.
- `state.json` always wins over `PROJECT.md` — just re-render.

These rules are also installed into the project's `CLAUDE.md` by `/pm:init` and re-injected
by the SessionStart hook (so they survive compaction). Two artifacts back them up: every
commit made while a detour is active is auto-logged to `.conductor/detours.log` by the hook
(deterministic), and minimal detours are logged there by `log-detour` (rule-driven).

## Importing an existing roadmap

If you have a roadmap doc (any markdown), register each item interactively — the conductor
does **not** parse roadmap files automatically.

1. Read the roadmap file; list the items for the user to confirm.
2. For each item: `/pm:epic add --id <slug> --title "…" --lane <lane> --priority P2 --status planned`
   - Choose lane: `openspec` | `superpowers` | `claude-code` | `decision` | `external`
3. `planned` items appear in PROJECT.md but are excluded from NEXT UP and lanes rollup.
4. When you create an OpenSpec change for a `planned` epic and run `/pm:sync`, it
   auto-transitions to `untriaged` and enters the normal triage flow.
5. Triage the backlog: set priorities, promote items to `queued` as work becomes ready.

`/pm:epic add` validates `--status` — unknown values are rejected with a clear error.

## Epic-level autonomy — the preflight scan

An epic can be granted broad execution trust so it runs through phase transitions and
destructive actions without a human present for each one — but ONLY after a preflight scan, and
autonomy never removes a genuine safety stop. This section defines the scan; the decision rule
and reporting obligations that consume its output are in the rules block re-injected into
CLAUDE.md (see `/pm:epic` → `set-autonomy`).

**When:** before setting any epic's `autonomy.level` to `"autonomous"` (see `set-autonomy` below).

**How to scan an epic (`epicId`):**

1. Read that epic's FULL source, not a summary — whichever is its lane's real progress source:
   - `openspec` lane: `openspec/changes/<epicId>/{proposal,design,tasks}.md` and everything under
     its `specs/` directory.
   - `superpowers` lane: the file at the epic's `planPath`.
   - `claude-code` lane: the epic's inline `stories[]` in `.conductor/state.json`.
   - `external`/tracker-linked: see the tracker-specific addendum below — pull the tracker issue
     first, it IS the source.
2. Reason over the WHOLE document — do not keyword-grep for "DROP"/"migration"/"rm". A shallow
   scan is worse than no scan: it creates false confidence and lets a real risk slip through
   silently. Full read is the only approach approved for this primitive (see the design doc's
   "Approaches considered" table for why keyword-triggered scanning was rejected).
3. Produce exactly two sections:
   - **Destructive-risk points** — anything that changes/deletes/migrates existing data or state
     in a way that could be hard to undo. For each: what it is, why it's risky, and whether a
     backup/restore path is obvious from the plan or not.
   - **Genuine unknowns** — real ambiguities or missing decisions that should NOT just be
     guessed on — things needing explicit human approval or clarification before this epic could
     run start-to-finish unattended.
4. Keep it SHORT and high-signal. If there is nothing destructive, say so plainly. If there is
   no genuine unknown, say so plainly. Padding the output with non-issues defeats the entire
   point — it is exactly what turns autonomous execution into a wall of blockers.
5. Present the findings as ONE batch of questions to the user, before execution starts. Record
   the answers with `set-autonomy <epicId> --preauthorize "<action>:<reason>"` (repeatable, one
   per approved item) and `--context "<note>"` (repeatable, one per piece of background supplied)
   — then, only once recorded, `set-autonomy <epicId> --level autonomous`.

This same read-and-scan process is the one reused, unchanged, by any future work that needs to
scan several epics at once (e.g. a parent epic's children) — it takes one epic id at a time
regardless of caller.

## Epic-hierarchy orchestration

Runs a whole parent epic's children unattended — batched by priority and dependency, each
dispatched as a fresh subagent. Builds on epic-level autonomy above; read that section first if
you haven't. No new persistent state: everything below is recomputed fresh from `parent`,
`priority`, `links`, and each child's `autonomy` block every time.

**When:** the user wants to run an entire hierarchy (a parent epic + its children) unattended,
not just one epic.

**The process:**

1. **Preflight EVERY child up front, not one at a time.** Run the epic-level-autonomy preflight
   scan (above) against every child of the parent. Consolidate all findings into ONE batch of
   questions presented to the user — across the whole hierarchy, not per-child. Record answers
   per child exactly as epic-level autonomy already works: `set-autonomy <child-id>
   --preauthorize "<action>:<reason>"` / `--context "<note>"`, then `set-autonomy <child-id>
   --level autonomous` once a child is cleared.
2. **Get the execution plan:** `node "$ENGINE" plan-hierarchy --parent <id>`. This prints
   `{ parent, batches: [{ batch, epics: [{ id, priority, autonomous }] }] }`. If any epic in the
   plan shows `autonomous: false`, that child wasn't cleared in step 1 — resolve that before
   dispatching it (do not dispatch a non-autonomous child; it will immediately hit decision-rule
   item (d), "no context to act on").
   - If `plan-hierarchy` exits non-zero naming a dependency cycle, that's a real data problem
     (two children `depends-on` each other) — fix the `links` before re-running, don't retry
     blindly.
3. **Dispatch batch by batch, in order.** For each batch: dispatch one
   `agents/hierarchy-child-executor` per epic in that batch — **in parallel** (multiple
   dispatches in the same turn) when the batch has more than one epic, since batch membership
   already means they have no dependency on each other. Do **not** start the next batch until
   every dispatch in the current batch has reported back.
   - A dispatch reporting `STATUS: blocked` — do not advance to a LATER batch that depends on
     that child (check the plan's batch order); batches unrelated to it may still proceed. Flag
     the blocked child for the human in the end-of-hierarchy report; do not auto-retry it.
   - A dispatch reporting `STATUS: stopped-for-genuine-unknown` — this is decision-rule item (d)
     firing correctly, not a bug. Surface it to the human now, same as a single-epic stop would.
4. **After all batches, write ONE consolidated end-of-hierarchy report:** what was asked (the
   step-1 preflight batch), what was done (fold in every dispatch's `DONE`), every `DECISIONS`
   entry across the whole hierarchy, and an explicit **controversial** flag on anything from
   `CONCERNS` or a WARN-class decision — these may affect other backlog items, which is exactly
   the seed a future portfolio-consistency pass would need. The parent epic's own status is
   **never auto-archived** by this process — that stays a human call, same as epic-level
   autonomy never auto-closes an epic either.
